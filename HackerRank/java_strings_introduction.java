"A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as 
some kind of variable." — Wikipedia: String (computer science)

This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:

String myString = "Hello World!"
The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is 
called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

Given two strings of lowercase English letters,  and , perform the following operations:

Sum the lengths of A and B .
Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
