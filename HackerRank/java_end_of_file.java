"In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in 
a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source." 
â€” (Wikipedia: End-of-file)

The challenge here is to read n lines of input until you reach EOF, 
then number and print all n lines of content.
